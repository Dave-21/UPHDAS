## Introduction & Goals

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>

### Introduction
The **Satellite Detection System** aims to capture night-sky images using a Raspberry Pi camera, **detect satellite streaks**, generate partial orbital elements, and compare them to official satellite catalogs. It then uploads the data to a **central server** for archival and further analysis.

### Goals
1. **Automated Observation**  
   - Run autonomously overnight, using weather forecasts to decide if the sky is sufficiently clear.

2. **Accurate Satellite Detection**  
   - Identify satellite streaks in images while filtering out planes, noise, and other false positives.

3. **TLE Generation & Matching**  
   - Perform plate solving to extract RA/Dec coordinates, then generate partial TLEs for cross-referencing known catalogs.

4. **Data Aggregation & Reporting**  
   - Centralize logs, TLE data, and optional images on a server, providing a basis for easy reporting or a web dashboard.

## Project Overview

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>

### High-Level Architecture
[Raspberry Pi + Camera + Scripts] | | Wi-Fi / LAN | [Central Server: Database + Web Interface]

1. **Raspberry Pi Unit**  
   - Captures images (nightly), processes them, optionally handles partial TLE generation.

2. **Central Server**  
   - Receives data from multiple Raspberry Pi units.
   - Stores results in a database or file system.
   - Optionally hosts a dashboard or API to monitor statuses.

### Workflow Summary
1. **Weather Check**: Query an API (e.g., Open-Meteo) to verify cloud coverage.  
2. **Camera Capture**: If clear, capture images at intervals throughout the night.  
3. **Detection & Plate Solving**:  
   - Use line detection (Hough transform) and Astrometry.net for plate solving.  
   - Generate partial orbital elements from RA/Dec/time data.  
4. **Comparison & Upload**:  
   - Optionally compare with Space-Track or N2YO.  
   - Upload logs, images, metadata, TLE data to the central server.

## Requirements

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>

### Hardware Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi 4 or 5** (recommended for sufficient processing power).  
- **IMX519-based Camera** (or Raspberry Pi HQ Camera).  
- **Lens**:
  - Wide lens (~5–10 mm) → ~50° FOV, or
  - Narrow lens (~50 mm) → ~10° FOV.
- **Power Supply** capable of supporting the Pi + camera + any heater/dew heater (~5V / 3A+).
- **Outdoor Enclosure** (weatherproof) and secure mounting solution.

### Software Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi OS** (64-bit recommended) or similar Linux distro.
- **Python 3.8+**.
- **Astrometry.net** for plate solving.
- **OpenCV** for image processing.
- **Requests / HTTP library** (e.g., Python `requests`) for uploading data & checking weather.
- **(Optional)**: Additional libraries for advanced detection (ML frameworks, etc.).

### Network & Server
- **Wi-Fi or Ethernet** access for the Pi to upload results.
- **Central Server** with enough storage to hold logs, TLE data, or optional images.

### External Services
- **Weather API** (e.g., Open-Meteo) for cloud coverage checks.
- **Satellite Catalog API** (e.g., N2YO, Space-Track) to compare orbits.

## Hardware Setup

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>

1. **Mounting & Enclosure**  
   - If **roof access** is restricted, secure the camera on a wall bracket or a pole.  
   - Ensure the lens can be angled skyward without interference.

2. **Power & Cables**  
   - Long outdoor-rated cable or local power outlets.  
   - Wi-Fi range check if no Ethernet connection is available.

3. **Heater / Dew Control** (Optional)  
   - Cold or humid climates may need a small heater strip or a fan to prevent condensation.

4. **Lens Focus & FOV**  
   - Wide lens captures more sky but with less detail.  
   - Narrow lens captures fewer passes but more precise streak data.

## Software & Environment Setup

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>

1. **Operating System**  
   - Flash Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) onto a microSD card.  
   - Run initial setup (enable SSH if needed).

2. **Installing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip astrometry.net libopencv-dev
   pip3 install opencv-python numpy requests
   # add any other libraries as needed

Astrometry.net Index Files

Estimate your camera’s field of view.
Download appropriate 4100-series (Tycho-2) or 5200-series (Tycho-2 + Gaia) index files.
Place them in /usr/share/astrometry or a directory referenced in /etc/astrometry.cfg.
Weather API Setup

Sign up for a free or paid plan (e.g., Open-Meteo, AccuWeather).
Store the API key in .env or a config file.
(Optional) Additional Tools

If you want to do advanced analysis, consider ML frameworks (PyTorch, etc.).
For debugging or data visualization, install matplotlib, jupyter, etc.

Logging
Decide on a logging directory (/var/log/satellite_detection or logs/ under your project).
Configure logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN) in config.yaml.

Operation
<details> <summary><strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>
Typical Nightly Workflow
Check Weather
If cloud coverage < threshold, proceed. Otherwise, skip imaging.
Camera Capture
Run a capture script (e.g., every 2–5 seconds or on a timed schedule).
Streak Detection
Use Hough transform or morphological operations to find line segments.
Filter out short/dashed lines (planes, noise).
Plate Solving
Run solve-field (Astrometry.net) to map streak endpoints from pixel coords to RA/Dec.
TLE Generation
From multiple RA/Dec/time points, estimate partial orbit or just store raw data.
Compare with official catalogs if desired.
Upload to Server
Send logs, TLE data, or images (compressed) to a central server.
The server can store or display them as needed.
Scheduling & Automation
Cron or systemd timers on the Pi to run a nightly_runner script.
Error Handling: If camera fails or network drops, logs should indicate the cause.
</details>
Data Flow & Storage
<details> <summary><strong>Click to Expand</strong></summary>
Local Storage

Images: Saved in a structured directory (e.g., ~/images/YYYY-MM-DD/).
Partial TLE / RA-Dec Files: Possibly JSON, CSV, or a small local DB (SQLite).
Server Storage

A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) or NoSQL store (e.g., MongoDB).
Tables/collections for:
Observations (metadata about the pass, time, Pi location, etc.).
TLE Data (if you store final or partial TLE sets).
Logs or event records.
Retention & Backup

Decide how long to keep raw images before purging to free space.
TLE data is relatively small; can be kept indefinitely or archived.
Catalog Comparison

If using Space-Track or N2YO, store relevant satellite IDs or cross-match data.
Possibly run a job each morning to finalize which satellite was identified.
